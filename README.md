# 🛍️  E-commerce React SPA

#### This is an e-commerce Single Page Application proyect I made using ReactJS with Vite.
It renders cards with fake data pulled from a firestore database and lets the user simulate a buying process. \
When 'Send Order' is pressed it generates a document in the database with the items that were on the cart.
